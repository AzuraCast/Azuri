![Overview Photos](https://i.ninjalabs.dev/onbicck.png)

**Azuri** is currently in active development with new features and bugs fixed on the daily and is not a *final product* in any means. Azuri was created to support the new and up coming radio's that take use of [AzuraCast] and provide a platform to bride the gap from the community to the radio. 

## Hosted or Self Hosted?
**Azuri** is hosted allowing anyone to invite the bot using [this invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=773671716529504267&permissions=3411008&scope=bot) into their server and experiance it to it's full potential. Want to go the extra mile and make it custom? Fllow the steps below.

## Prerequisites
